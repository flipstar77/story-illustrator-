In the darkness between worlds, sealed away from the plane that rejected him, Yawgmoth waited. Not in silence—for silence suggests peace—but in the screaming chorus of machinery and transformation. In the twisted geometries of an artificial plane where metal learned to breathe and flesh learned to obey.

This is the story of what he built there. Of the nine spheres he shaped into his image. Of the paradise that became a hell. Of perfection pursued until it consumed everything that made life worth living.

The Thran had sealed him away, thinking distance would protect them. They could not have known that isolation would only give him time. Time to perfect his vision. Time to build an empire of oil and agony. Time to create beings that would one day carry his gospel of completion to every corner of the Multiverse.

This is Phyrexia. The Machine Hell. The Nine Spheres. And for five thousand years, it was Yawgmoth's alone.

Before we descend into what it became, we must first understand what it was. Before Yawgmoth's touch corrupted every surface and shadow. Before the oil seeped into its foundations and the screams of transformation echoed through its depths.

The plane that would become Phyrexia was old even before it earned its name. An artificial world, built by a planeswalker whose identity has been lost to time. We know only fragments about this creator. That they were humanoid in origin but preferred to take the form of a dragon. That they possessed knowledge of plane-crafting that few have ever matched. And that they died there, alone, their body decaying in the deepest sphere of their creation.

When the planeswalker Dyfed first brought Yawgmoth to this nameless plane, it was not yet the nightmare it would become. The first sphere—the surface—was almost beautiful in its strangeness. Artificial forests spread beneath a simulated sun, their trees made of metal but covered in something like moss, something that grew and changed and responded to the seasons programmed into the plane's structure. Serpentine creatures coiled around metallic trunks, their bodies an amalgam of organic tissue and crude mechanical components. Strange birds wheeled through the sky, their wings catching light in ways that suggested both feather and bronze.
